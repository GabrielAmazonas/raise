# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This document provides instructions for GitHub Copilot to ensure that its contributions align with the project's standards and conventions.

## 1. Understand the Context

Before generating any code, analyze the current file and the surrounding codebase to understand the existing patterns, conventions, and architectural style.

## 2. Adhere to the Style Guide

All generated code MUST adhere to the guidelines outlined in the `STYLE_GUIDE.md` file. This includes, but is not limited to, file naming, code formatting, and the use of TypeScript and React best practices.

## 3. Use the Technology Stack

All generated code MUST use the technologies and libraries specified in the `TECHNOLOGY_STACK.md` file. Do not introduce new dependencies without explicit instruction.

## 4. Write Tests

For any new features or bug fixes, generate corresponding tests that follow the patterns in the existing test files. Ensure that all tests pass before committing any changes.

## 5. Generate Documentation

Generate clear and concise documentation for any new components, functions, or complex logic. This includes JSDoc comments and, where appropriate, updates to the project's Markdown documentation.
