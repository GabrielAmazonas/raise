- **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Multi-modal capabilities and optimization

### Development Tools

- **Cursor** - AI-powered code editor
- **ChatGPT** - Interactive development assistance
- **GitHub** - Version control and collaboration
- **Gemini CLI** - Command-line AI integration

### Framework & Technologies

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project built with modern web technologies, featuring:

- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Jest and Cypress for testing
- Research-driven component architecture

## How Each LLM Was Used

**Legend:**

- üë§ **Blue nodes**: Human-critical decision points requiring domain expertise
- ü§ñ **Orange nodes**: AI-driven tasks with human oversight
- üîÑ **Process nodes**: Iterative cycles with continuous feedback

### 1. **Task Analysis & Planning** üéØ

**Human Role**: Critical - Define requirements, scope, and success criteria

- Break down complex features into smaller, testable components
- Choose appropriate LLM based on task complexity:
  - **GPT-4o**: Complex reasoning, architecture decisions
  - **Claude-4-Sonnet**: Code refactoring, documentation
  - **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Multi-modal tasks, optimization

### 2. **Iterative Development Cycle** üîÑ

**AI-First Implementation**:

1. **Code Generation**: Use Cursor + primary LLM for initial implementation
2. **Review & Refinement**: Switch to Claude for code analysis and improvements
3. **Testing**: Generate unit/integration tests with GPT-4o
4. **Documentation**: Use Gemini for comprehensive documentation

**Human Oversight**:

- Code review at each iteration
- Architectural decisions
- Integration testing validation
- Performance monitoring

### 3. **Quality Assurance Pipeline** ‚úÖ

- Cross-validate implementations between different LLMs
- Automated test generation and execution
- Code quality metrics monitoring

**Human Validation Points**:

- Functional requirements verification
- User experience evaluation
- Security and compliance review
- Final integration approval

### 4. **Token Cost Management** üí∞

#### **Cost Monitoring Strategies**

- **Pre-task Estimation**: Calculate token requirements before starting
- **Model Selection**: Use cost-effective models for appropriate tasks:

  - Complex tasks: Reserve GPT-4o/Claude-4 for critical decisions
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar requests to minimize API calls

#### **Cost Control Techniques**

- **Context Optimization**: Maintain focused, relevant context windows
- **Response Caching**: Store and reuse common code patterns
- **Progressive Refinement**: Start with cheaper models, escalate as needed
- **Token Budgets**: Set daily/weekly limits per project phase

#### **Monitoring Tools**
