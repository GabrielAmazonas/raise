# AI Diary - 2026-01-28

## Session Summary

Prepared README.md for Zenodo DOI submission by aligning it with the academic paper in `tex/conference_101719.tex`.

---

## Change: README.md Alignment with Academic Paper

### Objective

Update README.md to match the tex file's proposal content, focusing on tool/model name abstraction and generalization for Zenodo submission.

### Changes Made

1. **Abstracted Tool/Model Names:**
   - Replaced specific product names (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with generalized model class terminology:
     - "Large Reasoning Model" for strategic ideation
     - "High-Context Coding Model" for code generation
     - "Long-Context Infrastructure Agent" for infrastructure/documentation
     - "Quality Agent" for code review

2. **Aligned Structure with Academic Paper:**
   - Added formal Abstract section matching the paper
   - Restructured around the Tripartite Workflow (Strategic Layer, Execution Layer, Governance & Infrastructure Layer)
   - Added Policy-as-Code governance section
   - Included Discussion and Impact section with preliminary results

3. **Added Academic Elements:**
   - References section matching the paper's bibliography
   - Citation block in BibTeX format for researchers
   - DOI placeholder for Zenodo submission
   - Formal language consistent with the IEEE paper format

4. **Preserved Practical Implementation Details:**
   - Getting Started section with development commands
   - Project structure overview
   - Coverage thresholds and pre-commit pipeline configuration
   - Verification commands for testing

### Verification

- Ran `npm run format` to ensure Prettier compliance
- README structure now mirrors the academic paper sections
- Tool-agnostic terminology allows the framework to remain relevant as specific LLM models evolve

### Files Modified

- `README.md` - Complete rewrite to align with `tex/conference_101719.tex`

## Change: README.md Redundancy Cleanup

### Issue

User identified repeating content from line 152 onwards.

### Root Cause

The initial rewrite duplicated concepts in multiple sections:

1. Document-as-Code (DaC) explained in Strategic Layer AND had its own section
2. Agent roles (Strategist, Builder, Librarian) described in workflow AND in a Model Class table
3. "Reference implementation" intro text appeared twice

### Fix Applied

- Removed standalone "Document-as-Code (DaC)" section (lines 152-165)
- Removed redundant "Model Class Implementations" table
- Consolidated reference implementation intro into one location
- README reduced from 307 to 281 lines

### Verification

- Ran `npm run format` - formatting passed
- Content now follows single-source-of-truth principle

---

## Change: Synchronized References with PaperCards

### Objective

Align README and tex file references with the scientific papers displayed in PaperCards component.

### Changes Made

Added two missing papers from `src/lib/data.ts` to both README and tex file:

1. **S. Maatouk et al., "Large Language Models (LLMs): Deployment, Tokenomics and Sustainability"** - Huawei, University of Ottawa, 2024 (arXiv:2405.17147)
2. **OpenAI et al., "Early science acceleration experiments with GPT-5"** - OpenAI, Harvard University, University of Cambridge, 2025 (arXiv:2511.16072)

Also added arXiv URL to the existing "Attention Is All You Need" reference.

### Files Modified

- `README.md` - References section updated (now 8 references)
- `tex/conference_101719.tex` - Bibliography updated (now 8 bibitems)

### Verification

- References now match PaperCards data in `src/lib/data.ts`
- README and tex file references are synchronized

---

### Next Steps

- Submit to Zenodo to obtain DOI
- Update DOI placeholder in README once assigned
- Consider creating a CITATION.cff file for GitHub citation support
