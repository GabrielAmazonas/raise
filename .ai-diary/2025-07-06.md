## TypeScript and Jest Configuration Fixes

**Initial Problem:** TypeScript errors in `.test.tsx` files, specifically with `toBeInTheDocument` from `@testing-library/jest-dom`.

**Troubleshooting Journey:**

1.  **Initial Diagnosis:** Suspected missing type definitions for `jest-dom`.
2.  **Attempted Fix 1:** Modified `tsconfig.test.json` to include `src/types/jest-dom.d.ts`. This was incorrect as it overrode the base `tsconfig.json`'s `include` array.
3.  **Generated Error:** `npx tsc --noEmit` still failed, as the type definitions were not being correctly included.
4.  **Attempted Fix 2:** Removed the custom `src/types/jest-dom.d.ts` and updated `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.test.json` to rely on the built-in types from the `@testing-library/jest-dom` package. This was a step in the right direction, but still incomplete.
5.  **Generated Error:** `npx tsc --noEmit` continued to fail, indicating a deeper configuration issue.
6.  **Attempted Fix 3:** Isolated test-related types by removing them from the main `tsconfig.json` and adding them only to `tsconfig.test.json`. Also, explicitly excluded test files from the main `tsconfig.json`.
7.  **Generated Error:** `npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.test.json` failed because the `exclude` from the base `tsconfig.json` was overriding the `include` in `tsconfig.test.json`.
8.  **Attempted Fix 4:** Overrode the `exclude` property in `tsconfig.test.json` to prevent it from excluding the test files.
9.  **Resolution (TypeScript):** `npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.test.json` finally passed, confirming the TypeScript configuration was correct.

**New Problem:** "React refers to a UMD global" error in test files.

**Troubleshooting Journey:**

1.  **Initial Diagnosis:** Suspected an issue with the JSX transform in the test environment.
2.  **Attempted Fix 1:** Added a `transform` key to `jest.config.js` to explicitly use `@swc/jest`.
3.  **Generated Error:** `npm test` failed with a `SyntaxError` because the `replace` tool corrupted the `jest.config.js` file.
4.  **Attempted Fix 2:** Restored `jest.config.js` to its original state and re-applied the `transform` property with the correct syntax.
5.  **Generated Error:** `npm test` failed again with a `SyntaxError` due to another corruption of the `jest.config.js` file.
6.  **Attempted Fix 3:** Wrote the entire corrected content to `jest.config.js` to ensure its integrity.
7.  **Generated Error:** `npm test` failed with a `Validation Error` because the `@swc/jest` package was not found.
8.  **Attempted Fix 4:** Installed the `@swc/jest` package as a dev dependency.
9.  **Resolution (Jest):** `npm test` finally passed, confirming that the JSX transform issue was resolved.

**Outcome:** All TypeScript and Jest configuration issues are now resolved. The test suite is running successfully.

## [Session Update - 2025-07-06]

### Summary of Changes

- Applied a retro 8-bit club theme across the site, including:
  - Neon magenta and yellow color palette, deep purple/dark gray backgrounds, and pixel font.
  - Neon borders, pixelated card edges, and retro grid background overlay.
- Updated the Header/Navbar:
  - Logo and nav links use neon colors, pixel font, and uppercase styling.
  - Improved responsiveness and reduced font sizes for a more compact look.
- Hero section:
  - Main title uses neon accent and pixel font, subtitle uses neon yellow.
  - Background set to solid black for a bold, arcade look.
- Projects section:
  - Background set to dark gray (#181028) for contrast with the hero section.
  - Project titles use neon accent color and pixel font.
  - Removed the "Featured" badge from project cards for a cleaner look.
- General:
  - All text and UI elements now follow the 8-bit club color and style reference provided by the user.

**All changes were tested for visual consistency and theme adherence.**

## [Documentation Update - 2025-07-06]

### Summary of Changes

- **Updated Cursor Rules (.cursor/rules/project/project_rules.mdc):**
  - Added requirement to break changes into smaller functions for terminal execution
  - Included comprehensive testing guidelines (unit, integration, e2e)
  - Added AI diary logging requirements for both successful changes and errors
  - Included tech stack awareness (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Jest, Cypress)
  - Restructured rules for better clarity and alignment with user requirements

- **Updated Contributing Guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md):**
  - Enhanced development workflow to include testing and AI diary steps
  - Added detailed AI diary requirements section with success and error logging
  - Included comprehensive testing guidelines with specific frameworks and locations
  - Added tech stack specifics section
  - Included commit message format examples
  - Aligned all guidelines with user rules about incremental changes and verification

### Root Cause for Updates

The original documentation lacked alignment with the user's specific requirements about:

1. Breaking changes into smaller, testable functions
2. Mandatory AI diary logging for tracking progress and issues
3. Comprehensive testing requirements (unit/integration/e2e)
4. Tech stack-specific guidelines

### Verification

- Both files now comprehensively cover all user requirements
- Documentation is structured for easy reference by AI agents
- Guidelines are actionable and specific to the project's tech stack

**Outcome:** Documentation now fully aligns with user requirements and provides clear guidance for AI agents working on this project.

## [Cost Analysis - 2025-07-06]

### AI Model Usage and Token Estimation

**Models Used:**

- **Claude-4-Sonnet (Cursor):** Primary model for UI/UX theme implementation
- **Google Gemini-2.5 Pro:** Used for documentation updates and analysis

### Token Usage Estimates

#### 8-bit Theme Implementation Session

- **Input Tokens:** ~15,000 tokens (file reading, context analysis, theme reference)
- **Output Tokens:** ~8,000 tokens (CSS updates, component changes, explanations)
- **Total Tokens:** ~23,000 tokens

#### Documentation Updates Session

- **Input Tokens:** ~12,000 tokens (reading existing docs, analyzing requirements)
- **Output Tokens:** ~6,000 tokens (updated rules, contributing guidelines, diary entries)
- **Total Tokens:** ~18,000 tokens

### Cost Breakdown (USD)

#### Claude-4-Sonnet (via Cursor)

- **Input:** 15,000 tokens × $0.003/1K = $0.045
- **Output:** 8,000 tokens × $0.015/1K = $0.120
- **Subtotal:** $0.165

#### Google Gemini-2.5 Pro

- **Input:** 12,000 tokens × $0.00125/1K = $0.015
- **Output:** 6,000 tokens × $0.00375/1K = $0.0225
- **Subtotal:** $0.0375

### Total Session Cost

**Estimated Total:** $0.2025 USD (~$0.20)

### Cost Efficiency Notes

- Gemini-2.5 Pro provided better cost efficiency for documentation tasks
- Claude-4-Sonnet excelled at complex UI/UX implementation requiring visual understanding
- Combined approach optimized both capability and cost for different task types
